# NKTD prediction
___

## Idea
Sometimes it's good to have some GIS curve in a well, but it was out of the company budget to write it.

The idea is to learn a machine learning regression model to predict one curve based on the others, and then use it for prediction.

**This repo contains:**
* The models folder - contains pretrained data transformer, and prediction model;
* ProjectCode - contains the code, that starts the programm execution;
* ProjectFiles - contains files that are needed for programm to work properly.

For now the model is traines to predict NKTD curve based on GR and BK.
